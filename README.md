Ever been frustrated at the lack of flexibility for styling your hyperlinks? Ever wondered how sites like Pitchfork and Medium are able to dynamically style their links? If so, Stylish Links is for you! With the click of a button, automatically apply beautiful CSS3 styles to all of the existing links within your post and page content without conflicting with your current theme styles.

Stylish Links gives you full control over your link text, underline, and background colors, and most importantly, independent control over all of the hover effects. You can even control the underline thickness and offset from the bottom of the link text.

Works in all modern browsers and runs purely from CSS requiring no javascript, so your site remains virtually untouched from a performance perspective.
